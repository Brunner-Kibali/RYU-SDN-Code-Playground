RYU Part2:
=========

In this part , we are going to start writing the sample RYU applications step by step.

I will be explaining the openflow protocol and openvswitch commands whereever required.



Base Rule for beginners:
Please copy the example application file and modify as per your needs.

In this ryu exercises, i am going to use Openflow 1.3 Version, and use simple_switch_13.py as example program to start with.


I copied the simple_switch_13.py file in ryu-projects folder.
